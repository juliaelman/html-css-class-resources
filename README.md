## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to these resources! I thought it might be helpful I'd like to spell out some guidelines when contributing:

### LESS/CSS

Please only edit the `site.less` file when making any changes to styling and place into `static/less` folder. Compile your changes as `site.css` and place it into `static/css` folder, as layed out in this repository.
